📦 Stock Management System (C Language)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Stock Management System developed in C language.
It allows users to register products, manage quantities and prices, monitor stock levels, and generate detailed inventory reports.

The goal of this project is to apply programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and basic data management concepts while solving a real-world problem.

🎯 Objectives

Practice structured programming in C

Use arrays, loops, conditions, and functions

Handle user input safely

Perform calculations and generate reports

Understand basic inventory and stock control logic

🛠️ Features

✔ Register up to 30 products
✔ Store product codes, quantities, and prices
✔ Automatic calculation of:

Total stock quantity

Total stock value

Average value per product

✔ Stock status detection:

Stock sufficient

Stock low

Alert stock

Out of stock

✔ Identify:

Most expensive product

Cheapest product

✔ Supplier discount system:

Applies 10% discount if total stock value exceeds 10,000 DH

✔ List of products that need restocking

🧠 Concepts Used

Arrays

Loops (for, do-while)

Conditional statements (if / else)

Variables and data types

User input/output (scanf, printf)

Basic arithmetic operations

Program logic and validation

💻 Technologies

Language: C

Compiler: GCC (or any standard C compiler)

Platform: Console application

▶️ How to Run the Program

Compile the program:

gcc stock_management.c -o stock


Run the executable:

./stock


Follow the on-screen instructions to enter product data.

📊 Example Output

Inventory table with product details

Stock status for each product

Global statistics (total quantity, total value)

Discount calculation if conditions are met

List of products requiring restocking

📚 What I Learned

Designing a complete console application in C

Managing multiple related data using arrays

Writing clean and readable procedural code

Applying logic to real-life scenarios

Improving problem-solving and analytical thinking

This project strengthened my foundation for future studies in computer science and cybersecurity, where structured logic and attention to detail are essential.

🚀 Future Improvements

Save data to files (file handling)

Search and filter products by code

Add user authentication

Improve user interface

Migrate to a database-based system
